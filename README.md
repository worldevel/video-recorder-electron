## Development

If you want to hack on this project, here is how you do it.

<details><summary>Show building instructions</summary>

#### Installing dependencies

Install Node.js 16 first (or if you use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), switch to Node.js 16 by running `nvm use`).

<details><summary>Extra dependencies for Windows</summary>

```bash
npm install --global --production windows-build-tools
```
</details>

<details><summary>Extra dependencies for GNU/Linux</summary>

X11, PNG and zlib development packages are necessary. On Debian-like systems then can be installed as follows:

```bash
sudo apt install libx11-dev zlib1g-dev libpng-dev libxtst-dev
```
</details>

Install all required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Starting in development mode

```bash
npm start
```

The debugger tools are available when running in dev mode and can be activated with keyboard shortcuts as defined here https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-debug#features.

It can also be displayed automatically from the `SHOW_DEV_TOOLS` environment variable such as:

```bash
SHOW_DEV_TOOLS=true npm start
```

or from the application `--show-dev-tools` command line flag.

#### Building the production distribution

```bash
npm run dist
```


#### Publishing

1. Create release branch: `git checkout -b release-1-2-3`, replacing 1-2-3 with the desired release version
2. Increment the version: `npm version patch`, replacing `patch` with `minor` or `major` as required
3. Push release branch to github: `git push -u origin release-1-2-3`
4. Create PR: `gh pr create`
5. Once PR is reviewed and ready to merge, create draft Github release: `gh release create v1.2.3 --draft --title 1.2.3`, replacing v1.2.3 and 1.2.3 with the desired release version
6. Merge PR
7. Github action will build binaries and attach to the draft release
8. Test binaries from draft release
9. If all tests are fine, publish draft release

## Known issues

### Windows

A warning will show up mentioning the app is unsigned upon first install. This is expected.

### macOS

On macOS Catalina a warning will be displayed on first install. The app won't open unless "open" is pressed. This dialog is only shown once.

### GNU/Linux





<details><summary>NOTE for old GNU/Linux distributions</summary>

You might get the following error:

```
FATAL:nss_util.cc(632)] NSS_VersionCheck("3.26") failed. NSS >= 3.26 is required.
Please upgrade to the latest NSS, and if you still get this error, contact your
distribution maintainer.
```
